How to apply my knowledge of CSS grid and gain experience in mobile responsiveness.

### Help Wanted

You will notice the second .card "Jonathan Walters" uses 1fr for its row height where the others are auto-filled so they only take up the height of the container on smaller screen sizes.

Screenshot below.

Can any one help explain why this .card and the .card "Daniel Clifford" with the purple background are using 1fr and not autofill. Suggestions on how to fix this?
